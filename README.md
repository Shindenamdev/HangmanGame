# HangmanGame
A Javascript Hangman is a word-guessing game. In this game, the user is offered with a variety of game themes such as fruit, animals, and French gastronomy. We will present a word guessing game as the user selects one of the topics connected to that subject. If the user is unable to complete the quiz, a hangman will be formed for each incorrect response.
